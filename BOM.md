**All-in-all that's 388,30€. All that is without postage or customs, so this
price could still fluctuate a tad.**

Also, you could maybe save a few bucks left and right. It doesnt have to be
gdstime fans for example, and a 120W PSU will also do the job.  With that out
of the way, happy sourcing and building!
