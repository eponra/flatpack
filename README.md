# flatpack
There is not a lot to unpack. Like... for real.

###### Technical Data:

- folded volume of roughly 220x210x75mm (so, make sure your spoolbox has that
  inner dimension, as there are some with slightly different dimensions)
- buildvolume of 120x114x114mm, so 1.6 liters
- heated bed
- powered through an external (!) powerbrick with 150W, uses 100W max
- the design would theoretically allow for an AC bed, and then a small psu
  inside for having everything in one box but that was deemed to dangerous for
  the average user by me, so i did not went that way

###### Some words of caution:


- As you can imagine, a fixed bed cantilever is not optimal for fast speeds or
  a big printvolume.
- Thankfully, we dont have to deal with a big printvolume, but with speed. Or
  better: the rapid change of directions. This is a problem with any movement
  system, and it is even more with this.
- So why the fixed bed cantilever? Because it simply looks cool.
- Also, i used dual rails for load distribution for Y and Z; these are a bit
  problematic to align, and can and will cost you a few grey hairs.


## This is free for everyone to download and build, or of course to just look
   at it and take some ideas from it. :)

- its a (functioning) prototype, and with that will get much more work done

###### ToDo-List
- the XY-joiner is right now not printable on flatpack. In reprap-fashion everything should be though. That will be fixed
- with that said, the XY-joiner is also too complicated to print. With the redesign to be able to be printed on flatpack, i hope i will also tackle that.
- flathead has no spoolholder. I want to design a spoolholder, that can travel along in the spoolbox of your actual spool youÂ´re carrying with you
- i may want to change to a Mellow Orbiter Extruder, as that seems to be the better extruder. Also its nearly the same shape, and the same price
- the 3-mount-bedmounting is not optimal, as i simply drilled holes and threaded M3 threads into that. I may find a better solution down the road
- you can twist the base. Thats not supposed to happen, and one solution is to drill through the aluminium extrusions to get screws into the extrusions under the bed. I think there must also be another way...

###### A few words of gratitude:

The initial idea of a fixed bed cantilever was not mine, but came from
[apsu](https://github.com/apsu), a constant resident of the
#reprap-and-custombuilds channel in the [3D Printing
discord](https://discord.gg/pQRvDQHk67).  With this i built flathead, the
bigger brother of flatpack, and without [apsu](https://github.com/apsu/) none
of this would have happened.

The initial idea to make this foldable, came from @Ogre.  Also, special thanks
to [oliof](https://github.com/oliof/), another extremely helpful member and Mod
of 3D printing, and also a walking dictionary on obscure 3D printing and
mechanical knowledge.  And of course, a thank you to everyone else i forgot
from 3D printing and especially the #reprap-and-custombuilds channel.

Also, everyone nagging me multiple times a day in the super secret
#wheres-flatpack channel...
