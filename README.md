# flatpack
There is not a lot to unpack. Like... for real.

###### Technical Data:
- folded volume of roughly 220x210x75mm (so, make sure your spoolbox has that inner dimension, as there are some with slightly different dimensions)
- buildvolume of 120x114x114mm, so 1.6 liters
- heated bed
- powered through an external (!) powerbrick with 150W, uses 100W max
- the design would theoretically allow for an AC bed, and then a small psu inside for having everything in one box
but that was deemed to dangerous for the average user by me, so i did not went that way

###### Some words of caution:
- As you can imagine, a fixed bed cantilever is not optimal for fast speeds or a big printvolume.
- Thankfully, we dont have to deal with a big printvolume, but with speed. Or better: the rapid change of
directions. This is a problem with any movement system, and it is even more with this.

- So why the fixed bed cantilever? Because it simply looks cool.

- Also, i used dual rails for load distribution for Y and Z; these are a bit problematic to align, and
can and will cost you a few grey hairs.


## This is free for everyone to download and build, or of course to just look at it and take some ideas from it. :)

###### A few words of gratitude:
The initial idea of a fixed bed cantilever was not mine, but came from @Apsu, a constant resident of the
#reprap-and-custombuilds channel in the 3D Printing discord.
With this i build flathead, the bigger brother of flatpack, and without @Apsu none of this would have happened.
The initial idea to make this foldable, came from @Ogre.
Also, special thanks to @Oliof, another extremely helpful member and Mod of 3D printing, and also a walking dictionary
on obscure 3D printing and mechanical knowledge.
And of course, a thank you to everyone else i forgot from 3D printing and especially the #reprap-and-custombuilds channel.

Also, everyone nagging me multiple times a day in the super secret #Wheres-flatpack channel...
